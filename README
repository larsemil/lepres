I was sitting at home planning a presentation i was going to hold. Opened up a powerpoint and started and thought - hey, i am a webdeveloper and i am really bad at this. Why dont i make something in html instead. So i started. Only then did i realise that it would take a heck load of work to get the presentation to work the way i wanted and that i would probably be far better of with something that could help me.
Hence lepres was born. 

lepres is a framework for creating html5 presentations. It uses jquery as controller(like switching slides etc). Mainly it creates new pages, and keeps record in what order they are to be displayed. 

Here are some of the features:
* Individual css for each slide.
* Individual javascript for each slide.
* Include the latest webtechnologies there are, directly in your slide
* Youtube, html5video / audio. Everything is easily included on your slide.

for now the backend is finnished and the main focus now should be on the jquery controler. 

But something must be bad about this: YES! You have to know how to code html and css to be able to get anything betterlooking then a old webpage from 99. Of course the plan is to have a default layout that will do for most presentations.
